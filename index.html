				<p>Hi! My name is Julia Pannewitz, and I have been living in Los Angeles, California, for the past two years.  I am originally from Virginia, where I earned my Bachelor's Degree in German and Linguistics from the University of Mary Washington.  I enjoy living in LA because of the perfect weather and proximity to the beach and mountains.  As a result, my new hobby is hiking.</p>
				<p>As my area of study in college suggests, I love learning languages.  I speak German fluently and have taken courses in the following languages as a hobby: Spanish, Italian, Yiddish, Chinese, Luxemburgish, and French.</p>
				<p>I currently work as a retail manager for your favorite coffee company.  In the evenings and on weekends I am participating in the UCLA Coding Boot Camp, which is why you are here. Enjoy my profile!</p>
